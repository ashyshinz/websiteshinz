              <a href="#" class="blog-title">Why Doing Things Alone Is So Important?</a>
              <p>I used to detest being by myself. I was afraid of it. I've always felt unproductive and depressed when I wasn't around people—my friends and my family.  But as time went on, I realized the importance of spending time alone myself.
                You don't have to worry about other people's opinions or try to impress anyone when you're by yourself. Put differently, you are free to be who you truly are.
                You will discover more about the true you when you are being who you are. You might not discover that you truly enjoy listening to rnb music or that you're skilled at dancing or painting when you're influenced by other people. 𓍢ִ໋🌷͙֒ 𓍢ִ໋🌷͙֒

            <a href="#" class="blog-title">Coping Anxiety</a>
             <p>All of us have occasionally experienced tension or anxiety, and most of the time, this is normal.  However, having struggled with general anxiety for most of my life, I've had to learn coping mechanisms for my emotions and thoughts. Finding the reason behind your feelings is the first step in managing these emotions. Although it may seem obvious, our minds frequently exaggerate even relatively insignificant events in order to make us feel powerless.  I've discovered that the majority of the time when I experience anxiety, it comes from irrationality and is typically caused by worry about unrealized fears. 
              I first try to slow my breathing and practice reflective thinking when my mind starts to race and I start to lose control. I first ask myself what specifically is worrying me, and then I determine whether the worry is for the now or for the future. Almost invariably, it begins with "What if..." and is a worry about the future—something that hasn't happened yet.
      What happens if I'm disliked by everyone? What happens if I don't pass this class?What happens if my parents don't like who I am? “
      In situations like this, I remind myself that worrying about it now won't make the hurt or anxiety I'll experience later, when that "what if" really happens, go away.
      Essentially, it all comes down to remaining present. Since life consists only of the moments you are currently experiencing, anxiety can be greatly reduced when you start to focus entirely on each one of these times rather than on the past or future. ε(´｡•᎑•`)っ 💕

            <a href="#" class="blog-title">Why I take pictures of literally everything and everyone</a>
            <p>Everyone who knows me well understands my constant loyalty to my camera. Some of my best memories are captured on my black digi cam. Even if I were thirty minutes late, it would still take me an additional ten minutes to find the camera that I am so determined to bring with me to the mall, friend outings, or any kind of gala. My camera and makeup would be the first things I would grab to save from my burning house.
              Without photography and the capacity to freeze moments in time, such as laughing with the ones you love, visiting parks or beaches, grinning with your family and friends, reading a book, or watching a movie, I genuinely think that life becomes a stop-motion movie of forgotten memories. 
              I'm inspired to take even MORE images since some of them bring back memories that I would have forgotten entirely if I hadn't shot the original picture. 
      
      I want to remember everything that I did and the people I loved. Above all, I think, I just want my life to have some essential significance captured in the flash of my camera lens so that my future children (if ever i will have lol)  would know who their mother was. .. 🫧💗✨
